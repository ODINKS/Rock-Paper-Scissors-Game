# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game.

This is a simple version of the rock, scissors, paper game created with Python program.

## Basic Information.

The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors.

The winners are determined by these set of rules:
* Rock beats Scissors.
* Paper beats Rock, and
* Scissors beats Paper.

If two players choose the same character, it's a tie, and the game repeats.

In this simple version of the game, one player is controlled by the computer and the other player is controlled by the user.

## Installation.

Simply run the Python program after pulling the file from repository.

## Usage.

* When the program is run, the game asks the user to pick an option from “R”, “P” or “S”.

* If the user input at first is not among the option, the program prints an error and asks for user’s input again.

* If user input is correct, the program prints both players’ moves in the format: “Player(Rock) : CPU(Paper).”

* Then, the program checks for both players’ moves.

* If there's a winner (according to the game rule), it prints the winner, and program ends.

* If there is a tie (i.e. the Player and CPU pick the same move), the program restarts by asking for user input.
